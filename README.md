# VSCode UI Scripting README

This VSCode plugin aims to deliver a configurable UI context toolset that will allow quicker development within your team and projects.

## Scenarios

- If you need to create a custom scaffold for your project structure - creating a new component with a required set of sub elements etc.
- Generating a large set of objects or data based off of templates.
- and anything else you can think of.

## Working on extension

You will need to compile `npm run compile`, before running the script `F5`. - from that point on the launch script will be watching for changes.

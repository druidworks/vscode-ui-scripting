# VSCode UI Scripting

This VSCode plugin aims to deliver a configurable UI context toolset that will allow quicker development within your team and projects.

## Scenarios

- If you need to create a custom scaffold for your project structure - creating a new component with a required set of sub elements etc.
- Generating a large set of objects or data based off of templates.
- and anything else you can think of.

## Examples

### Configuration

You need to create a `vus-config.json` file in the root of the project.

it must list the commands you will be able to use later. here you will give your command a name you can reference later and a command that will be used to run after all inputs have been gathered. So each command must have a set of questions that will require input. As seen below you can have 3 variations:

- text input
- quick single pick
- quick multiselect (canPickMany boolean)

With regards to the quick pick options, if you specify the values field in a question it will automatically be converted to quick pick prompt. The detail field of the values will be used when calling the command you have designated.

If a user does not provide an answer for one of your questions it will default to `.`, but if you would like to specify something else, you just need to add `defaultAnswerValue` to your vus-config.json, see below. Spaces don't work so great when working with space sperated command line parameters ;)

```javascript
{
  "defaultAnswerValue": "-",
  "commands": [
    {
      "name": "addComponent",
      "command": "node index.js addComponent",
      "questions": [
        {
          "prompt": "What is your component name?",
          "placeholder": "Enter component name..."
        },
        {
          "prompt": "Select additional files to generate",
          "placeholder": "Select additional files to generate",
          "canPickMany": true,
          "values": [
            {
              "label": "styles.css",
              "Description": "Component CSS stylesheet",
              "detail": "styles.css"
            },
            {
              "label": "README.md",
              "Description": "Component README.md",
              "detail": "README.md"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Contextual Meta

Next you wil need to create `vus-meta.json` in the directories that you would like the context menu to have an effect, you can also drop the meta file in a parent directory to house all meta commands.

This meta file essentially controlls what commands (found in your `vus-config.json` file) are allowed to run when you right click a file or folder in the VSCode explorer.

```javascript
{
  "allowedDirectoryCommands": ["addComponent"],
  "allowedFileCommands": {
    "myComponent.js": ["processFile"]
  }
}
```

### Command Scripts

The final step would be write your scripts that you can call via the command field in your `vus-config.json` file. This can be anything you would run in the command line where you can pass parameters seperated by spaces.

**NB** - The first parameter of the commmand will always be the directory path you right clicked on or directory of the file you right clicked on. All other parameters will be returned based on the order of your questions specified in the `vus-config.json`.

```javascript
npm run addComponent param1 param2
node index.js addComponent param1 param2
```
